# DIFFversity

Promote learning, appreciating, understanding the differences. Don't judge. Don't hate. Learn. Appreciate. UNDERSTAND. The beauty is in the differences and what makes you different. It's not just disruption ... first we must *Learn. Appreciate. UNDERSTAND.*

### Seek out DIFFversity!

It's risk-free now ... it's just a matter of changing the habits of being yourself. Try something like visiting different trending repositories in the GitHub community ... or better yet, fork [and update] the [*github/explore repository](https://github.com/github/explore) with an aim toward really STUDYING ten great repositories per day and maybe creating your own [curated collections](https://github.com/collections).



DIFFversity is a fundamentally different learning paradigm, a DIFFERENT approach to thinking and learning ... we want to develop [the tools](https://diffgraph.github.io/) to allow people to exlore distinctions ... HYBRID cognitive intelligence has a theoretical, abstract, conceptual, mathematic difference -- for example, what can we learn from things like **different***ial* geometry how that might help make cognitive intelligence *different*?  

***LEARNING the difference*** is about BEING the difference by adopting a different approach to learning ... ... people want BE the *difference* or to make a *difference* ... but we always find that the value of information is in how it surprises, a *WTF* moment means that we have to adjust -- this is entirely about drawing focus to the small difference, the character of the difference ... it is like the unforgetable *lyric* ... we are learning how to *speak in the pompatus of DIFF.*
## DIFFlists

[This curated listing of annoated AWESOME reading list](https://diffwtf.github.io/readinglist) is an attempt to discuss or give some context to different work papers on the [topic of DIFFs in various papers](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=diff&searchtype=title&source=header) or the [set of topics surrounding differential geometry](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/dg.differential-geometry) ... this material might be highly technical or essentially quite mathematical in nature ... but at its core, it's just a group of really competent people doing some especially important and foundational work in advancing the state of human knowledge. After all,***it's the DIFFERENCES that matter!***

## DIFFcomp

The material on theoretial DIFFERENCE matters of course, but the world of [AWESOME computational DIFFs](https://diffwtf.github.io/awesomeDIFF) are highly used and intensely practical ... and, as awesome as the current set of tools are, it's rather obvious we have hardly begun to crack the surface in implementing DIFF algorithms -- DIFF is hardly something anyone can describe as *"merely esoteric"* or the kind of math that is beautiful, but someone might not ever use practically for 100 years or more ... we often just *minimize the diff* as in least-squared regression curve fitting or tensor analysis.

## DIFFcommit

The [***COMMIT blog***](https://diffwtf.github.io/commitizen) is about understanding the essential DIFFERENCES in open source development communities ... we all know that competetent programmer heroes and the founders of open source communities might be important, but we might not all know why those heros MUST *from the very start* work at attracting and growing the population of commitizens, the people who review their code and turn the development from being a one-person project into being something bigger.

Issues arise from differences or aberration from desired performance; these issues result in commits which drives the workflow of communities and swarms of commitizens... THIS is ***difference*** between open source collaborative development and the develop of a private, often proprietary software development system -- the open issue-driven workflow that includes swarms of commitizens is an entirely different, more sophisticated, more advanced organism. Proprietary software never really had a change against the commitizens of the open source realm.

## DIFFgraph

The [***DIFFgraph***](https://diffgraph.github.io/) *tool* or actually a format, which might better be described as something akin to a [*conventional commits*](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format is for social knowledge engineering. 

The vision for [***DIFFgraph***](https://diffgraph.github.io/) STARTS with something like an annotated, discussed graphical hybridization of different ideas, in the manner of what [what ConnectedPapers is about](https://www.connectedpapers.com/about) but it is intended to be a more democratized extension beyond pre-print scientific paper archives to things like Git repositories and beyond... the [***DIFFgraph***](https://diffgraph.github.io/) conversation threads themselves are data, which can be stored in Git repos, or threadrolled copies of jams on differences/similarities/hybridizations.
