# DIFF.wtf

The value of information is in how it surprises, a *WTF* moment means that we have to adjust -- this is entirely about drawing focus to the small difference, the character of the difference ... it is like the unforgetable *rhyme in a lyric, especially the* ***almost*** *kind of rhyme* that didn't follow the rules.

The [topic of DIFFs](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=diff&searchtype=title&source=header) is essentially quite mathematical, but hardly esoteric or the kind of thing that someone might use 100 years from now ... we often just *minimize the diff* as in least-squared regression curve fitting or tensor analysis ... but the DIFF is something that is worthy of our curiosity ... it's not exactly the complete reciprocal or mathematically total inverse of similarity, but just the tiny difference or unusual amount of noise that makes something fall flat, cause turbulence or disrupt the quiet flow that we thought we understood.
