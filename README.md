# DIFF.wtf

***Difference*** ... being the *difference*  ... making a *difference* ... *differential* geometry ... what is *different*?

The value of information is in how it surprises, a *WTF* moment means that we have to adjust -- this is entirely about drawing focus to the small difference, the character of the difference ... it is like the unforgetable *rhyme in a lyric, especially the* ***almost*** *kind of rhyme* that didn't follow the rules.

The DIFF topic is something that is worthy of our curiosity in many realms ... a DIFF is not exactly the complete reciprocal or mathematically total inverse of similarity, but just the tiny difference or unusual amount of noise that makes something fall flat, cause turbulence or disrupt the quiet flow that we thought we understood. It's not just the disruption, but what causes it and how the DIFF game can be played.

## DIFF Reading Lists

Curated AWESOME papers on the [topic of DIFFs in various papers](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=diff&searchtype=title&source=header) or the [set of topics surrounding differential geometry](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/dg.differential-geometry) is essentially quite mathematical in nature.

## DIFF computational implementations

The material on theoretial DIFFERENCE matters of course, but something like computational DIFFs are intensely practical ... and we have hardly begun to crack the surface in implementing DIFF algorithms -- DIFF is hardly something anyone can describe as *"merely esoteric"* or the kind of math that is beautiful, but someone might not ever use practically for 100 years or more ... we often just *minimize the diff* as in least-squared regression curve fitting or tensor analysis.
