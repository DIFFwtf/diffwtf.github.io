# DIFF.wtf

***Difference*** ... being the *difference*  ... making a *difference* ... *differential* geometry ... what is *different*?

The value of information is in how it surprises, a *WTF* moment means that we have to adjust -- this is entirely about drawing focus to the small difference, the character of the difference ... it is like the unforgetable *rhyme in a lyric, especially the* ***almost*** *kind of rhyme* that didn't follow the rules.

The DIFF topic is something that is worthy of our curiosity in many realms ... a DIFF is not exactly the complete reciprocal or mathematically total inverse of similarity, but just the tiny difference or unusual amount of noise that makes something fall flat, cause turbulence or disrupt the quiet flow that we thought we understood. It's not just the disruption, but what causes it and how the DIFF game can be played.

## DIFF Reading Lists

[This curated listing of annoated AWESOME reading list](https://diffwtf.github.io/readinglist) is an attempt to discuss or give some context to different work papers on the [topic of DIFFs in various papers](https://arxiv.org/search/?query=diff&searchtype=title&source=header) or the [set of topics surrounding differential geometry](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/tagged/dg.differential-geometry) ... this material might be highly technical or essentially quite mathematical in nature ... but at its core, it's just a group of really competent people doing some especially important and foundational work in advancing the state of human knowledge. After all,***it's the DIFFERENCES that matter!***

## DIFF computational implementations

The material on theoretial DIFFERENCE matters of course, but the world of [AWESOME computational DIFFs](https://diffwtf.github.io/awesomeDIFF) are highly used and intensely practical ... and, as awesome as the current set of tools are, it's rather obvious we have hardly begun to crack the surface in implementing DIFF algorithms -- DIFF is hardly something anyone can describe as *"merely esoteric"* or the kind of math that is beautiful, but someone might not ever use practically for 100 years or more ... we often just *minimize the diff* as in least-squared regression curve fitting or tensor analysis.

## DIFF commitizens

[This blog](https://diffwtf.github.io/commitizen) is about understanding the essential DIFFERENCES in open source development ... but we might focus first on the commitizens. 

Issues arise from differences or aberration from desired performance; these issues result in commits which drives the workflow of communities and swarms of commitizens ... THIS is ***difference*** between open source collaborative development and the develop of a private, often proprietary software development system -- the open issue-driven workflow that includes swarms of commitizens is an entirely different, more sophisticated, more advanced organism. Proprietary software never really had a change against the commitizens of the open source realm.
