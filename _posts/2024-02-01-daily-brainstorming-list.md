# Prompt engineering is part of listification

To really brainstorm, we need to PUSH a bit on brainstorming ... we cannot afford to just look at the top three or five as we normally do with *googlestorming* ideation. We really need to ***PUSH.***

In listification, we want to have roughly 250 pretty good ideas in the hopper. The REASON to have more ideas is use the ideas to GRIND on one another ... like how a threshing cylinder on corn combine shells corn by forcing the cobs to rub the kernels off the other cobs ... the combine certainly does NOT just pick off individual kernels and it does not even grind against a cob of corn, as with the action of a pencil sharpener grinding away wood ... the cylinder has to ***be charged*** full of cobs so that the fully populated cobs are threshing the kernels off one another as the mechanism forces them back against one another ... or the else the mechanism will just GRIND the kernels into dust like a coffee grinds ... so we really don't want to develop a five-item ToDo list until we have 250 items on our list. 

We will try to get to each of these sometimes in the next few months, but the top 50 are those things we should try to do as soon as practical ... the next 50 are the kinds of things that are waiting on something or depend upon circumstances developing or some triggering event happening ... middle 50 of the grand list of 250 are ideas that are good enough to keep thinking about, revising and improving, but not really optimally defined or well enough thought through to implement ... the next 50 are the bonehead skyhook ideas that makes us laugh and might provoke a future idea, so we keep kicking them around in the back parking lot ... and bottom 50 things that that are just stupid or wrong or bad or dangerous or just the kinds of ideas we might want to forget we ever had ... every so often the bottom 50 will get deleted or archived and forgotten.

But the TOP 50 most important list items we work on in the next month or maybe even sooner ... the top 10% or the best 5 items are things we're banging on almost every day, at least a bit, certainly the kinds of things that we want to get done before the week is over ... and the BEST idea is THE Big Thing we are working on RIGHT NOW.

Our top five list ... which might be closer to what everyone tends to think of as a *normal* ToDo list ... and it might stretch to 25 ... but PRACTICALLY, we sorta doubt whethere someone can really have more than five important things on a REAL ToDo list that we will try to knock off in the coming week.

Of course, our focus will be one the ONE main one ... the biggie that we are really focusing on, trying to get right.
