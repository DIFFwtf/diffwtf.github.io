Yes, we know that this writing needs an editor. Perhaps the point of the exercise ... do develop some editing skills. ***Mostly, the writing is still raw, dissheveled, lacking a cup of coffee and certainly not yet dressed-up for work.***

That's what listification is about ... EDITING ... lots of EDITING ... it's about CURATING personal [AWESOME lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome) and content collections ... which others might find useful ... but maybe not yet --**we mostly curate the lists for our future selves.**

It might be best to spend some time looking at the AWESOME pattern and the community that has sprung up around the [AWESOME topic](https://github.com/topics/awesome) ... or to look how it has influenced the pattern behind GitHub's [Curated Collections](https://github.com/collections).
