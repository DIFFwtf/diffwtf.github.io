Yes, we git it ...

... we KNOW that all of this writing needs some editing. 

But, perhaps the point of this exercise ... or at least it is one of the points ... it is about developing some editing skills. ***Mostly, the writing is still raw, dissheveled, lacking a cup of coffee and certainly not yet dressed-up for work.***

That's what listification is about ... EDITING ... lots of EDITING ... it's about CURATING personal [AWESOME lists](https://github.com/topics/awesome) and content collections ... which others might find useful ... but maybe not yet --**we mostly curate the lists for our future selves.**

It might be best to spend some time looking at the AWESOME pattern and the community that has sprung up around the [AWESOME topic](https://github.com/topics/awesome) ... or to look how it has influenced the pattern behind GitHub's [Curated Collections](https://github.com/collections).
