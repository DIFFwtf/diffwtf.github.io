# The essential DIFFERENCE of open source

## The community-founding HERO 
It's hopefully relatively obvious why all great project start with a HERO ... not just a visionary programmer who develops for the sake of the usefullness of the programmer's art, but also a **visionary founder of an open source development community** which will provide useful user/maintainer feedback and essential encouragement when that encouragement is needed most. Proprietary software does not have heroes who are community leaders; it has competent mercenaries. Understand this DIFFERENCE.

## The open source git flow

The git flow itself is gigantic ... and that does not begin to get at the value added by something like the open source GitLab workflow. There's a lot to grok when it comes to understanding workflows and the evolving code that is part of Git and GitLab ... Understand this DIFFERENCE.

## The commitizens

You don't have a community when you just have residents who gripe and whine. Communities are not made up of piles of rotting shit infested with disease-spreading maggots or gossips; communities are made up of volunteers who might not coordinate and manage all of the affairs of the operation, but in smaller matters like the debate over the logic/appropriateness of a particular commit, they genuinely advance the cause and advance the intellect of every other commitizen involved in the debate. It is not merely about understanding the DIFF in the code or the output from the CI/CD tests, ie that could be done by ML/AI ... it's really about the creative understanding about what this might mean or what kind of opportunities open up. Open soure commitizen group intelligence is different than proprietary software engineering team group intelligence. Understand this DIFFERENE.
